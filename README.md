# Kimchi

This repository contains **kimchi**, a general-purpose zero-knowledge proof system for proving the correct execution of programs.

You can read more about this project on the [Kimchi book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems), or for a lighter introduction in this [blogpost](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/kimchi-the-latest-update-to-minas-proof-system).

[See here for the rust documentation](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/rustdoc).

## User Warning

This project comes as is. We provide no guarantee of stability or support, as the crates closely follow the needs of the [Mina]([https://](https://github.com/minaprotocol/mina)) project.

If you use this project in a production environment, it is your responsibility to perform a security audit to ensure that the software meets your requirements.

## Organization

The project is organized in the following way:

* [book/](book/). The mina book, RFCs, and specifications. [Available here in HTML](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems).
* [curves/](curves/). The elliptic curves we use (for now just the pasta curves).
* [groupmap/](groupmap/). Used to convert elliptic curve elements to field elements.
* [hasher/](hasher/). Interfaces for mina hashing.
* [kimchi/](kimchi/). Our proof system based on PLONK.
* [poly-commitment/](poly-commitment/). Polynomial commitment code.
* [poseidon/](poseidon/). Implementation of the poseidon hash function.
* [signer/](signer/). Interfaces for mina signature schemes.
* [tools/](tools/). Various tooling to help us work on kimchi.
* [turshi/](turshi/). A Cairo runner written in rust.
* [utils/](utils/). Collection of useful functions and traits.

## Contributing

Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project.

## Generate rustdoc locally

An effort is made to have the documentation being self-explained, referring to the mina book for more details when necessary.
You can build the rust documentation with
<!-- This must be the same than the content in .github/workflows/gh-page.yml -->
```
rustup install nightly
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--enable-index-page -Zunstable-options" cargo +nightly doc --all --no-deps
```

You can visualize the documentation by opening the file `target/doc/index.html`.

## CI

<!-- Please update this section if you add more workflows -->
The CI will build different targets.
- [Deploy Specifications & Docs to GitHub Pages](.github/workflows/gh-page.yml).
  When CI passes on master, the documentation built from the rust code will be
  available [here](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/rustdoc) and the book
  will be available [here](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems).
