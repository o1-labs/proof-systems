# Saffron - a solution for mutable state management for Web3

This crate provides a binary (`saffron`) and utilities to manage efficiently a
mutable state using succinct proofs (SNARK).

## Binary

Current Features
- Encode and decode data into polynomials.
- Compute a commitment for given input data.
- Create a storage proof for given data.
- Verify the correctness of a storage proof.

## Usage

Run `cargo run --release --bin saffron -- --help` for the list of features with the appropriate arguments.

## Test

We provide an e2e test showing all the features executed sequentially in `./e2e-test.sh`. While not required,
it is recommended that you generate the Vesta SRS before running this script to avoid recomputing it several times.
You run this one-time-setup using

```bash
# Good time to grab a coffee...
cargo test -p kimchi heavy_test_srs_serialization --release
```

You can run this e2e test on any file. For example, to run with the provided lorem file using the SRS cache for testing:

```bash
./e2e-test.sh fixtures/lorem.txt ../srs/test_vesta.srs
```

Note that the log level can be controlled by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
