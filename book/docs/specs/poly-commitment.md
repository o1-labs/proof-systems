# Kimchi Polynomial Commitment

Our polynomial commitment scheme is a bootleproof-type of commitment scheme,
which is a mix of:

- The polynomial commitment scheme described in appendix A.1 of the
  [PCD paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1618).
- The zero-knowledge opening described in section 3.1 of the
  [HALO paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021).
