# Universal Reference String (URS)

```admonish
Note that the URS is called SRS in our codebase at the moment.
SRS is incorrect, as it is used in the presence of a trusted setup (which kimchi does not have). 
This needs to be fixed.
```

The URS comprises of:

* `Gs`: an arbitrary ordered list of curve points that can be used to commit to a polynomial in a non-hiding way.
* `H`: a blinding curve point that can be used to add hidding to a polynomial commitment scheme.

The URS is generated deterministically, and thus can be rederived if not stored.

As different circuits of different size do not share the same domain, and the size of the domain is directly equal to the number of `Gs` curve points we use to commit to polynomials, we often want to share the same URS of maximum size across many circuits (constraint systems).
Circuit associated with smaller domains will simply use a truncation of the shared URS.

```admonish
A circuit's domain is generated as the first power of 2 that is equal, or larger, to the number of gates used in the circuit (including zero-knowledge gates).
```

## Curve points to commit to a polynomial

The following pseudo-code specifies how the `Gs` curve points, as well as the `H` curve point, are generated.

```python
def create(depth):
    # generators
    Gs = []
    for i in range(0, depth):
        digest = Blake2b512.hash(be_encode(i))
        Gs.push(point_of_random_bytes(digest))

    # blinding point
    digest = (b"srs_misc" || be_encode(0))
    H = point_of_random_bytes(digest)

    #
    return (Gs, H)

def point_of_random_bytes(random_bytes):
    # packing in bit-representation
    const N: usize = 31
    let mut bits = [false; 8 * N]
    for i in range(0, N) {
        for j in range(0, 8) {
            bits[8 * i + j] = (random_bytes[i] >> j) & 1 == 1;
        }
    }

    let n = BigInt::from_bits_be(&bits);
    let t = G::BaseField::from_repr(n)
    return map.to_group(t)
```

TODO: specify `map.to_group` in the previous section.

## URS values in practice

As there is no limit to the number of commitment curve points you can generate, we only provide the first three ones to serve as test vectors.
