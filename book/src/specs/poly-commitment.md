# Kimchi Polynomial Commitment

Our polynomial commitment scheme is a bulletproof-type of commitment scheme, which is a mix of:

* The polynomial commitment scheme described in appendix A.1 of the [PCD paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1618).
* The zero-knowledge opening described in section 3.1 of the [HALO paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021).
