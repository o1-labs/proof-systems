# Free XOR
The Free-XOR optimization significantly improves the efficiency of garbled circuit. The garbler and evaluator could handle $\xor$ gates for free! The method is given in [KS08](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vlad/papers/XOR_ICALP08.pdf).

- The garbler chooses a global uniformly random string $\Delta$ with $\lsb(\Delta) = 1$.

- For any $\xor$ gate with input wires $a,b$ and output wire $c$, the garbler chooses uniformly random labels $X_a$ and $X_b$. 

- Let $X_a$ and $X_a\oplus \Delta$ denote the 0 label and 1 label for input wire $a$, respectively. Similarly for wire $b$. 

- Let $X_a\oplus X_b$ and $X_a\oplus X_b\oplus \Delta$ denote the 0 label and 1 label for input wire $c$, respectively.

- The garbler does not need to send garbled gate for each $\xor$ gate. The evaluator locally $\xor$s the input labels of $\xor$ gate to gets the output label. This is correct because given a $\xor$ gate, the label table could be as follows.

|$a$|$b$|$c$|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|$X_a$|$X_b$|$X_a\oplus X_b$|
|$X_a$|$X_b\oplus \Delta$|$X_a\oplus X_b\oplus \Delta$|
|$X_a\oplus \Delta$|$X_b$|$X_a\oplus X_b\oplus \Delta$|
|$X_a\oplus \Delta$|$X_b\oplus \Delta$|$X_a\oplus X_b$|

Here are some remarks of the Free-XOR optimization.
- Free XOR is compatible with the point-and-permute optimization because $\lsb(\Delta) = 1$.

- The garbler should keep $\Delta$ private all the time for security reasons.

- Garbling $\and$ gate is the same as before except that all the labels are of the form $(X,X\oplus \Delta)$ for uniformly random $X$.
