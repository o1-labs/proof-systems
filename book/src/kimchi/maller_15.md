# Maller's optimization for Kimchi

This document proposes a protocol change for [kimchi](../specs/kimchi.md).

## What is Maller's optimization?

See the [section on Maller's optimization](../plonk/maller.md) for background.

## Overview

We want the verifier to form commitment to the following polynomial:

$$
L(x) = f(x) - Z_H(\zeta) \cdot t(x)
$$

They could do this like so:

$$
\mathsf{com}(L) = \mathsf{com}(f) - Z_H(\zeta) \cdot \mathsf{com}(t)
$$

Since they already know $f$, they can produce $\mathsf{com}(f)$, the only thing they need is $\mathsf{com}(t)$. So the protocol looks like that:

```sequence
Prover->Verifier: com(t)
Note right of Verifier: generates random point zeta
Verifier->Prover: zeta

Note right of Verifier: verifies the evaluation proof \n to check that L(zeta) = 0
```

In the rest of this document, we review the details and considerations needed to implement this change in [kimchi](../specs/kimchi.md).

## How to deal with a chunked $t$?

There's one challenge that prevents us from directly using this approach: $\mathsf{com}(t)$ is typically sent and received in several commitments (called chunks or segments throughout the codebase). As $t$ is the largest polynomial, usually exceeding the size of the SRS (which is by default set to be the size of the domain).

### The verifier side

Thus, the **verifier** will have to produce split commitments of $L$ and combine them with powers of $\zeta^n$ to verify an evaluation proof. Let's define $L$ as:

$$
L = L_0 + x^n L_1 + x^{2n} L_1 + \cdots
$$

where every $L_i$ is of degree $n-1$ at most.
Then we have that

$$
\mathsf{com}(L) = \mathsf{com}(L_0) + \mathsf{com}(x^n \cdot L_1) + \mathsf{com}(x^{2n} \cdot L_2) + \cdots
$$

Which the verifier can't produce because of the powers of $x^n$, but we can linearize it as we already know which $x$ we're going to evaluate that polynomial with:

$$
\mathsf{com}(\tilde L) = \mathsf{com}(L_0) + \zeta^n \cdot \mathsf{com}(L_1) + \zeta^{2n} \cdot \mathsf{com}(L_2) + \cdots
$$

### The prover side

This means that the **prover** will produce evaluation proofs on the following linearized polynomial:

$$
\tilde L(x) = 1 \cdot L_0(x) + \zeta^n \cdot L_1(x) + \zeta^{2n} \cdot L_2(x) + \cdots
$$

which is the same as $L(x)$ only if evaluated at $\zeta$. As the previous section pointed out, we will need $\tilde L(\zeta \omega)$ and $\tilde L(\zeta \omega) \neq L(\zeta \omega)$.

## Evaluation proof and blinding factors

To create an evaluation proof, the prover also needs to produce the blinding factor $r_{L}$ associated with the chunked commitment of:

$$
\tilde L = \tilde f - (\zeta^n - 1) \tilde t
$$

To compute it, there are two rules to follow:

* when two commitment are **added** together, their associated blinding factors get added as well:
    $$\mathsf{com}(a) + \mathsf{com}(b) \implies r_a + r_b$$
* when **scaling** a commitment, its blinding factor gets scaled too:
    $$n \cdot \mathsf{com}(a) \implies n \cdot r_a$$

As such, if we know $r_f$ and $r_t$, we can compute:

$$
r_{\tilde L} = r_{\tilde f} + (\zeta^n-1) \cdot r_{\tilde t}
$$

The prover knows the blinding factor of the commitment to $t$, as they committed to it. But what about $f$? They never commit to it really, and the verifier recreates it from scratch using:

1. **The commitments we sent them**. In the linearization process, the verifier actually gets rid of most prover commitments, except for the commitment to the last sigma commitment $S_{\sigma6}$. (TODO: link to the relevant part in the spec) As this commitment is public, it is not blinded.
2. **The public commitments**. Think commitment to selector polynomials or the public input polynomial. These commitments are not blinded, and thus do not impact the calculation of the blinding factor.
3. **The evaluations we sent them**. Instead of using commitments to the wires when recreating $f$, the verifier uses the (verified) evaluations of these in $\zeta$. If we scale our commitment $\mathsf{com}(z)$ with any of these scalars, we will have to do the same with $r_z$.

Thus, the blinding factor of $\tilde L$ is  $(\zeta^n-1) \cdot r_{\tilde t}$.

## The evaluation of $\tilde L$

The prover actually does not send a commitment to the full $f$ polynomial. As described in the [last check section](final_check.md). The verifier will have to compute the evaluation of $\tilde L(\zeta)$ because it won't be zero.
It should be equal to the following:

$$
\begin{align}
& \tilde f(\zeta) - \tilde t(\zeta)(\zeta^n - 1) = \\
& \frac{1 - z(\zeta)}{(\zeta - 1)(\zeta - \omega^{n-k})}\left[ \frac{(\zeta^n - 1)(\zeta - \omega^{n-k})}{n} \alpha^{\mathsf{PERM1}} + \frac{\omega^{n-k}(\zeta^n - 1)(\zeta - 1)}{n} \alpha^{\mathsf{PERM2}} \right] \\
& - \mathsf{pub}(\zeta) \\
& \; - z(\zeta) \cdot \mathsf{zkpm}(\zeta) \cdot \alpha^{\mathsf{PERM0}} \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[0](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[0] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[1](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[1] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[2](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[2] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[3](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[3] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[4](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[4] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[5](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[5] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[6](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \mathsf{shift}[6] \zeta + \gamma)  \\
& \; + z(\zeta \omega) \cdot \mathsf{zkpm}(\zeta) \cdot \alpha^{\mathsf{PERM0}}  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[0](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \sigma[0](\zeta) + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[1](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \sigma[1](\zeta) + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[2](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \sigma[2](\zeta) + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[3](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \sigma[3](\zeta) + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[4](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \sigma[4](\zeta) + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[5](\zeta) + \beta \cdot \sigma[5](\zeta) + \gamma)  \\
& \; \qquad \qquad \cdot (w[6](\zeta) + \gamma) +
\end{align}
$$

Because we use the [inner product polynomial commitment](../plonk/polynomial_commitments.md), we also need:

$$
\tilde L(\zeta \omega) = \tilde f(\zeta \omega) - Z_H(\zeta) \cdot \tilde t(\zeta \omega)
$$
Notice the $Z_H(\zeta)$. That evaluation must be sent as part of the proof as well.

## The actual protocol changes

Now here's how we need to modify the current protocol:

1. The evaluations $f(\zeta), f(\zeta \omega), t(\zeta), t(\zeta \omega)$ (and their corresponding evaluation proofs) don't have to be part of the protocol anymore.
2. The prover must still send the chunked commitments to $t$.
3. The prover must create a linearized polynomial $\tilde L$ by creating a linearized polynomial $\tilde f$ and a linearized polynomial $\tilde t$ and computing:
    $$\tilde L = \tilde f + (\zeta^n-1) \cdot \tilde t$$
4. While the verifier can compute the evaluation of $\tilde L(\zeta)$ by themselves, they don't know the evaluation of $\tilde L(\zeta \omega)$, so the prover needs to send that.
5. The verifier must recreate $\mathsf{com}(\tilde L)$, the commitment to $\tilde L$, themselves so that they can verify the evaluation proofs of both $\tilde L(\zeta)$ and $\tilde L(\zeta\omega)$.
6. The evaluation of $\tilde L(\zeta \omega)$ must be absorbed in both sponges (Fq and Fr).

The proposal is implemented in [#150](https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/pull/150) with the following details:

* the $\tilde L$ polynomial is called `ft`.
* the evaluation of $\tilde L(\zeta)$ is called `ft_eval0`.
* the evaluation $\tilde L(\zeta\omega)$ is called `ft_eval1`.
