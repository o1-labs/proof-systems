# non-interaction with fiat-shamir

So far we've talked about an interactive protocol between a prover and a verifier.
The zero-knowledge proof was also in the honest verifier zero-knowedlge (HVZK) model, which is problematic.

In practice, we want to remove the interaction and have the prover produce a proof by themselves, that anyone can verify.

## Public-coin protocols

public-coin protocols are protocols were the messages of the verifier are simply random messages.
This is important as our technique to transform an interactive protocol to a non-interactive protocol works on public-coin protocols.

## Fiat-Shamir trick

The whole idea is to replace the verifier by a random oracle, which in practice is a hash function.
Note that by doing this, we remove potential leaks that can happen when the verifier acts dishonestly.

Initially the Fiat-Shamir transformation was only applied to sigma protocols, named after the greek letter $\Sigma$ due to its shape resembling the direction of messages (prover sends a commit to a verifier, verifier sends a challenge to a prover, prover sends the final proof to a verifier).
A $Z$ would have made more sense but here we are.

## Generalization of Fiat-Shamir

As our protocol has more than three moves, where every even move is a challenge from the verifier, we need to generalize Fiat-Shamir.
This is simple: every verifier move can be replaced by a hash of the transcript (every message sent and received so far) to obtain a challenge.

## In practice: a duplex construction as Merlin

While we use a hash function for that, a different construction called the [duplex construction](https://keccak.team/sponge_duplex.html) is particularly useful in such situations as they allow to continuously absorb the transcript and produce challenges, while automatically authenticating the fact that they produced a challenge.

[Merlin](https://merlin.cool/) is a standardization of such a construction using the [Strobe protocol framework](https://strobe.sourceforge.io/) (a framework to make use of a duplex construction).
Note that the more recent [Xoodyak](https://keccak.team/xoodyak.html) (part of NIST's lightweight competition) could have been used for this as well.
Note also that Mina uses none of these standards, instead it simply uses Poseidon (see section on poseidon).
