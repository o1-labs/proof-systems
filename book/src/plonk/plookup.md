# $\plookup$

$\plookup$ allows us to check if witness values belong to a look up table. This is usualy useful for reducing the number of constraints needed for bit-wise operations. So in the rest of this document we'll use the XOR table as an example.


| A   | B   | Y   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |


First, let's define some terms:

* **lookup table**: a table of values that means something, like the XOR table above
* **joint lookup table**: a table where cols have been joined together in a single col (with a challenge)
* **table entry**: a cell in a joint lookup table
* **single lookup value**: a value we're trying to look up in a table
* **joint lookup values**: several values that have been joined together (with a challenge)

A joint lookup table looks like this, for some challenge $\alpha$:

## Constraints

Computes the aggregation polynomial for maximum $n$ lookups per row, whose $k$-th entry is the product of terms:

$$
\frac{(\gamma(1 + \beta) + t_i + \beta t_{i+1}) \prod_{j=0}^n ( (1 + \beta) (\gamma + f_{i,j}) )}{\prod_{j=0}^{n+1} (\gamma(1 + \beta) + s_{i,j} + \beta s_{i+1,j})}
$$

for $i < k$.

* $t_i$ is the $i$-th entry in the table
* $f_{i, j}$ is the $j$-th lookup in the $i$-th row of the witness

For every instance of a value in $t_i$ and $f_{i,j}$, there is an instance of the same value in $s_{i,j}$

$s_{i,j}$ is sorted in the same order as $t_i$, increasing along the 'snake-shape'

Whenever the same value is in $s_{i,j}$ and $s_{i+1,j}$, that term in the denominator product becomes

$$(1 + \beta) (\gamma + s_{i,j})$$

this will cancel with the corresponding looked-up value in the witness 

$$(1 + \beta) (\gamma + f_{i,j})$$

Whenever the values $s_{i,j}$ and $s_{i+1,j}$ differ, that term in the denominator product will cancel with some matching

$$(\gamma(1 + \beta) + t_{i'} + \beta t_{i'+1})$$

because the sorting is the same in $s$ and $t$.

There will be exactly the same number of these as the number of values in $t$ if $f$ only contains values from $t$.
After multiplying all of the values, all of the terms will have cancelled if $s$ is a sorting of $f$ and $t$, and the final term will be $1$
because of the random choice of $\beta$ and $\gamma$, there is negligible probability that the terms will cancel if $s$ is not a sorting of $f$ and $t$

But because of the snakify:

* we are repeating an element between cols, we need to check that it's the same in a constraint
* we invert the direction, but that shouldn't matter

## FAQ

* how do we do multiple lookups per row?
* how do we dismiss rows where there are no lookup?
