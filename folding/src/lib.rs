//! This library implements basic components to fold computations expressed as
//! multivariate polynomials of any degree. It is based on the "folding scheme"
//! described in the [Nova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370.pdf) paper.
//! It implements different components to achieve it:
//! - [quadraticization]: a submodule to reduce multivariate polynomials
//! to degree `2`.
//! - [decomposable_folding]: a submodule to "parallelize" folded
//! computations.
//!
//! Examples can be found in the directory `examples`.
//!
//! The folding library is meant to be used in harmony with the library `ivc`.
//! To use the library, the user has to define first a "folding configuration"
//! described in the trait [FoldingConfig].
//! After that, the user can provide folding compatible expressions and build a
//! folding scheme [FoldingScheme]. The process is described in the module
//! [expressions].
// TODO: the documentation above might need more descriptions.
