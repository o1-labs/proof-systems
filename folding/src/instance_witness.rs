//! This module defines a list of traits and structures that are used by the
//! folding scheme.
//! The folding library is built over generic traits like [Instance] and
//! [Witness] that defines the the NP relation R.
//!
//! This module describes 3 different types of instance/witness pairs:
//! - [Instance] and [Witness]: the original instance and witness. These are the
//! ones that the user must provide.
//! - [ExtendedInstance] and [ExtendedWitness]: the instance and witness
//! extended by quadraticization.
//! - [RelaxedInstance] and [RelaxedWitness]: the instance and witness related
//! to the relaxed/homogeneous polynomials.
//!
//! Note that [Instance], [ExtendedInstance] and [RelaxedInstance] are
//! supposed to be used to encapsulate the public inputs and challenges. It is
//! the common information the prover and verifier have.
//! [Witness], [ExtendedWitness] and [RelaxedWitness] are supposed to be used
//! to encapsulate the private inputs. For instance, it is the evaluations of
//! the polynomials.
//!
//! A generic trait [Foldable] is defined to combine two objects of the same
//! type using a challenge.

// FIXME: for optimisation, as values are not necessarily Fp elements and are
// relatively small, we could get rid of the scalar field objects, and only use
// bigint where we only apply the modulus when needed.
