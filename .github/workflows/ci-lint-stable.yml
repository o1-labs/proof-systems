# Lint workflow for Rust stable
#
# This workflow runs clippy on the latest stable Rust toolchain.
# Initially, all crates are excluded. As each crate is fixed to support
# stable Rust, it should be removed from the exclude list.

# Tracking issue: https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/issues/1926
# Sub-issues for each crate: #1927-#1949
# This workflow issue: https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/issues/1950
