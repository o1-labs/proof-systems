//! This module contains the implementation of the IVC scheme in addition to
//! running an arbitrary function that can use up to [crate::NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS]
//! columns.
//! At the moment, all constraints must be of maximum degree
//! [crate::MAX_DEGREE], but it might change in the future.
//!
//! The implementation relies on a representation of the circuit as a 2D array
//! of "data points" the interpreter can use.
//!
//! An interpreter defines what a "position" is in the circuit and allow to
//! perform operations using these positions.

//! private inputs.
//!
//! On top of these abstraction, gadgets are implemented.
//! For the Nova-like IVC schemes, we describe below the different gadgets and
//! how they are implemented with this abstraction.

//! ## Gadgets implemented
//!
//! ### Elliptic curve addition
//!
//! The Nova augmented circuit requires to perform elliptic curve operations, in
//! particular additions and scalar multiplications.
//!
//! To reduce the number of operations, we consider the affine coordinates.
//! As a reminder, here the equations to compute the addition of two different
//! points `P1 = (X1, Y1)` and `P2 = (X2, Y2)`. Let define `P3 = (X3, Y3) = P1 +
//! P2`.
//!
//! ```text
//! - λ = (Y1 - Y2) / (X1 - X2)
//! - X3 = λ^2 - X1 - X2
//! - Y3 = λ (X1 - X3) - Y1
//! ```
//!
//! Therefore, the addition of elliptic curve points can be computed using the
//! following degree-2 constraints
//!
//! ```text
//! - Constraint 1: λ (X1 - X2) - Y1 + Y2 = 0
//! - Constraint 2: X3 + X1 + X2 - λ^2 = 0
//! - Constraint 3: Y3 - λ (X1 - X3) + Y1 = 0
//! ```
//!
//! If the points are the same, the λ is computed as follows:
//!
//! ```text
//! - λ = (3 X1^2 + a) / (2Y1)
//! ```
//!
//! #### Gadget layout
//!
//! For given inputs (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the layout will be as follow:
//!
//! ```text
//! | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 | C10 | C11 | C12 | C13 | C14 | C15 | C16 | C17 |
//! | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 | b0 | λ  | x3 | y3 |    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
//! ```
//!
//! where `b0` is equal two `1` if the points are the same, and `0` otherwise.
//!
//! TBD/FIXME: supports negation and the infinity point.
//!
//! TBD/FIXME: the gadget layout might change when we will implement the
//! permutation argument. The values `(x1, y1)` can be public inputs.
//! The values `(x2, y2)` can be fetched from the permutation argument, and must
//! be the output of the elliptic curve scaling.
//!
//! The gadget requires therefore 7 columns.
//!
//! ### Hash - Poseidon
//!
//! Hashing is a crucial part of the IVC scheme. The hash function the
//! interpreter does use for the moment is an instance of the Poseidon hash
//! function with a fixed state size of
//! [crate::curve::PlonkSpongeConstants::SPONGE_WIDTH]. Increasing the
//! state size can be considered as it would potentially optimize the
//! number of rounds, and allow hashing more data on one row. We leave this for
//! future works.
//!
//! A direct optimisation would be to use
//! [Poseidon2](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323) as its performance on CPU is
//! better, for the same security level and the same cost in circuit. We leave
//! this for future works.
//!
//! For a first version, we consider an instance of the Poseidon hash function
//! that is suitable for curves whose field size is around 256 bits.
//! A security analysis for these curves give us a recommandation of 60 full
//! rounds if we consider a 128-bit security level and a low-degree
//! exponentiation of `5`, with only full rounds.
//! In the near future, we will consider the partial rounds strategy to reduce
//! the CPU cost. For a first version, we keep the full rounds strategy to keep
//! the design simple.
//!
//! When applying the full/partial round strategy, an optimisation can be used,
//! see [New Optimization techniques for PlonK's
//! arithmetisation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/462). The techniques described
//! in the paper can also be generalized to other constraints used in the
//! interpreter, but we leave this for future works.
//!
//! #### Gadget layout
//!
//! We start with the assumption that 17 columns are available for the whole
//! circuit, and we can support constraints up to degree 5.
//! Therefore, we can compute 4 full rounds per row if we rely on the
//! permutation argument, or 5 full rounds per row if we use the "next row".
//!
//! We provide two implementations of the Poseidon hash function. The first one
//! does not use the "next row" and is limited to 4 full rounds per row. The
//! second one uses the "next row" and can compute 5 full rounds per row.
//! The second implementation is more efficient as it allows to compute one
//! additional round per row.
//! For the second implementation, the permutation argument will only be
//! activated on the first and last group of 5 rounds.
//!
//! The layout for the one not using the "next row" is as follow (4 full rounds):
//! ```text
//! | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 | C10 | C11 | C12 | C13 | C14 | C15 |
//! | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | x  | y  | z  | a1 | a2 | a3 | b1 | b2 | b3 | c1  | c2  | c3  | o1  | o2  | o3  |
//! ```
//! where (x, y, z) is the input of the current step, (o1, o2, o3) is the
//! output, and the other values are intermediary values. And we have the following equalities:
//! ```text
//! (a1, a2, a3) = PoseidonRound(x, y, z)
//! (b1, b2, b3) = PoseidonRound(a1, a2, a3)
//! (c1, c2, c3) = PoseidonRound(b1, b2, b3)
//! (o1, o2, o3) = PoseidonRound(c1, c2, c3)
//! ```
//!
//! The layout for the one using the "next row" is as follow (5 full rounds):
//! ```text
//! | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 | C10 | C11 | C12 | C13 | C14 | C15 |
//! | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | x  | y  | z  | a1 | a2 | a3 | b1 | b2 | b3 | c1  | c2  | c3  | d1  | d2  | d3  |
//! | o1 | o2 | o2
//! ```
//! where (x, y, z) is the input of the current step, (o1, o2, o3) is the
//! output, and the other values are intermediary values. And we have the
//! following equalities:
//! ```text
//! (a1, a2, a3) = PoseidonRound(x, y, z)
//! (b1, b2, b3) = PoseidonRound(a1, a2, a3)
//! (c1, c2, c3) = PoseidonRound(b1, b2, b3)
//! (d1, d2, d3) = PoseidonRound(c1, c2, c3)
//! (o1, o2, o3) = PoseidonRound(d1, d2, d3)
//! ```
//!
//! For both implementations, round constants are passed as public inputs. As a
//! reminder, public inputs are simply additional columns known by the prover
//! and verifier.
//! Also, the elements to absorb are added to the initial state at the beginning
//! of the call of the Poseidon full hash. The elements to absorb are supposed
//! to be passed as public inputs.
//!
//! ### Elliptic curve scalar multiplication
//!
//! The Nova-based IVC schemes require to perform scalar multiplications on
//! elliptic curve points. The scalar multiplication is computed using the
//! double-and-add algorithm.
//!
//! We will consider a basic implementation using the "next row". The
//! accumulators will be saved on the "next row". The decomposition of the
//! scalar will be incrementally on each row.
//! The scalar used for the scalar multiplication will be fetched using the
//! permutation argument (FIXME: to be implemented).
//! More than one bit can be decomposed at the same time, and we could reduce
//! the number of rows.
//! We leave this for future work.
//!
//! #### Gadget layout
//!
//! For a (x, y) point and a scalar, we apply the double-and-add algorithm, one step per row.
//! Therefore, we have 255 rows to compute the scalar multiplication.
//! For a given step `i`, we have the following values:
//! - `tmp_x`, `tmp_y`: the temporary values used to keep the double.
//! - `res_x`, `res_y`: the result of the scalar multiplication i.e. the accumulator.
//! - `b`: the i-th bit of the scalar.
//! - `r_i` and `r_(i+1)`: scalars such that r_(i+1) = b + 2 * r_i.
//! - `λ'` and `λ`: the coefficients
//! - o'_x and o'_y equal to `res_plus_tmp_x` and `res_plus_tmp_y` if `b == 1`,
//! otherwise equal to `o_x` and `o_y`.
//!
//! We have the following layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! | C1   |   C2   |      C3       |      C4       |    C5     | C7 |       C7       |       C8       | C9 | C10 |   C11    | C12 | C13 | C14 | C15 | C16 | C17 |
//! | --   | -----  | ------------- | ------------- | --------- | -- | -------------- | -------------- | -- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | o_x  |  o_y   | double_tmp_x  | double_tmp_y  |    r_i    | λ  | res_plus_tmp_x | res_plus_tmp_y | λ' |  b  |
//! | o'_x |  o'_y  | double_tmp'_x | double_tmp'_y |  r_(i+1)  |
//! ```
//!
//! FIXME: an optimisation can be implemented using "a bucket" style algorithm,
//! as described in [Efficient MSMs in Kimchi
//! Circuits](https://github.com/o1-labs/rfcs/blob/main/0013-efficient-msms-for-non-native-pickles-verification.md).
//! We leave this for future work.
//!
//! ## Handle the combinaison of constraints
//!
//! The prover will have to combine the constraints to generate the
//! full circuit at the end. The constraints will be combined using a
//! challenge (often called α) that will be generated in the verifier circuit by
//! simulating the Fiat-Shamir transformation.
//! The challenges will then be accumulated over time using the random coin used
//! by the folding argument.
//! The verifier circuit must be carefully implemented to ensure that all the
//! messages that the prover would have sent before coining the random combiner
//! for the constraints has been absorbed properly in the verifier circuit.
//!
//! Using this technique requires us a folding scheme that handles degree
//! `5 + 1` constraints, as the challenge will be considered as a variable.
//! The reader can refer to the folding library available in this monorepo for
//! more contexts.
//!
//! ## Permutation argument
//!
//! Communication between rows must be done using a permutation argument. The
//! argument we use will be a generalisation of the one used in the [PlonK
//! paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953).
//!
//! The construction of the permutations will be done using the methods prefixed
//! `save` and `load`. The index of the current row and the index of the
//! time the value has been written will be used to generate the permutation on
//! the fly.
//!
//! The permutation argument described in the PlonK paper is a kind of "inverse
//! lookup" protocol, like Plookup. The polynomials are defined as follows:
//!
//! ```text
//!            Can be seen as T[f(X)] = Χ
//!          --------
//!          |      |
//! f'(X) = f(X) + β X + γ
//!                      |--- Can be seen as the evaluation point.
//!                         |
//!                         |
//! g'(X) = g(X) + β σ(X) + γ
//!          |      |
//!          --------
//!          Can be seen as T[g(X)] = σ(X)
//! ```
//!
//! And from this, we build an accumulator, like for Plookup.
//! The accumulator requires to coin two challenges, β and γ, and it must be
//! done after the commitments to the columns have been absorbed.
//! The verifier at the next step will verify that the challenges have been
//! correctly computed.
//! In the implementation, the accumulator will be computed after the challenges
//! and the commitments. Note that the accumulator must also be aggregated, and
//! the aggregation must be performed by the verifier at the next step.
//!
//! The methods `save` and `load` will accept as arguments only a column that is
//! included in the permutation argument. For instance, `save_poseidon_state`
//! will only accept columns with index 3, 4 and 5, where the
//! `load_poseidon_state` will only accepts columns with index 0, 1 and 2.
//!
//! The permutations values will be saved in public values, and will contain the
//! index of the row. The permutation values will be encoded with a 32 bits
//! value (u32) as we can suppose a negligible probability that a user will use
//! more than 2^32 rows.
//!
//! The permutation argument also generates constraints that will be
//! homogenized with the gadget constraints.
//!
//! Note all rows might require to use the permutation argument. Therefore, a
//! selector will be added to activate/deactivate the permutation argument.
//! When a method calls `save` or `load`, the selector will be activated. By
//! default, the selector will be deactivated.
//!
//! TBD:
//! - number of columns
//! - accumulator column
//! - folding of the permutation argument
//!
//! TBD/FIXME: do we use a additive permutation argument to increase the number
//! of columns we can perform the permutation on?
//!
//! TBD/FIXME: We can have more than one permutation argument. For instance, we
//! can have a permutation argument for the columns 0, 1, 2, 3 and one for the
//! columns 4, 5, 6, 7. It can help to decrease the degree.
//!
//! ## Fiat-Shamir challenges
//!
//! The challenges sent by the verifier must also be simulated by the IVC
//! circuit.
//!
//! For a step `i + 1`, the challenges of the step `i` must be computed by the
//! verifier, and check that it corresponds to the ones received as a public
//! input.
//!
//! TBD/FIXME: specify. Might require foreign field arithmetic.
//!
//! TBD/FIXME: do we need to aggregate them for the end?
//!
//! ## Folding
//!
//! Constraints must be homogenized for the folding scheme.
//! Homogenising a constraint means that we add a new variable (called "U" in
//! Nova for instance) that will be used to homogenize the degree of the monomials
//! forming the constraint.
//! Next to this, additional information, like the cross-terms and the error
//! terms must be computed.
//!
//! This computation depends on the constraints, and in particular on the
//! monomials describing the constraints.
//! The computation of the cross-terms and the error terms happen after the
//! witness has been built and the different arguments like the permutation or
//! lookup have been done. Therefore, the interpreter must provide a method to
//! compute it, and the constraints should be passed as an argument.
//!
//! When computing the cross-terms, we must compute the contribution of each
//! monomial to it.
//!
//! The implementation works as follow:
//! - Split the constraint in monomials
//! - For the monomials of degree `d`, compute the contribution when
//! homogenizing to degree `d'`.
//! - Sum all the contributions.
//!
//! The library [mvpoly] can be used to compute the cross-terms and to
//! homogenize the constraints. The constraints can be converted into a type
//! implementing the trait [MVPoly](mvpoly::MVPoly) and the method
//! [compute_cross_terms](mvpoly::MVPoly::compute_cross_terms) can be used from
//! there.
