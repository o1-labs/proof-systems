## Typed Fiat Shamir

This is an attempt to type the Fiat Shamir transform and to add type-safeness to
IOP protocols.

An interactive oracle proof protocol is meant to describe messages different
parties exchange, messages forming a transcript.
In the case of arguments of knowledge, two parties exchange messages, a prover
and a verifier. The transcript can be seen as a shared tape between two Turing
machines representing the prover and the verifier.

When using the Fiat Shamir transformation, we instantiate the oracle with a hash
function (often using the mode of operation `Sponge` and an internal permutation).

Inspiration might come from different libraries and conversations with some persons:
- Michele Orru at zkSummit 10, after discussion his library [...] (missing links)
- Francois Garillot and his library [...] (missing links)
- Matthew Ryan

I try to design it from scratch, and similarities with other works should be
mentioned. If you think there are missing credits, please, let me know.
Some designs might be inspired from
previous designs I wrote in OCaml. For instance, particular the permutation and the sponge mode comes from
[ocaml-bls12-381-hash](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/cryptography/ocaml-bls12-381-hash).

What the library should be able to encode:
- different permutations
- different internal state size of the permutation
- absorb different type of values

An idea would be to encode the oracle at the round level, and the round has its own Oracle definition.
In the oracle definition, there is:
- the number and type of previous messages absorbed and squeezed.
- the original state size of the permutation
- the type of elements the permutation contains

A round is defined as some operations performed by a party, ending by writing some values on the shared tape.
When the prover sends messages to the verifier, it will write the message on the
shared tape. And when the verifier sends messages (i.e. when we "squeeze" the
sponge, it will be also a message written on the shared tape. An important part
of the design is how to describe the shared tape, and how messages are read/written.
The transcript can be seen as the concatenatation of heteregenous typed list
(and its size must be define at the type level).

\                           \ --------- /
                              Verifier
                              sends a
                              challenge
                              after
                              "squeezing"
  ---------------------- SHARED TAPE = TRANSCRIPT -------------------------------------------
```

### Sponge design

The first thing to design is the mode of operation `Sponge`.
The mode relies on an internal permutation, working on a state of size `N`. The
permutation should be interchangeable (i.e. Hades/Poseidon/Poseidon2, Rescue, Griffin, Anemoi,
etc).
The natural idea is to represent the internal permutation using a trait `PERMUTATION`, parametrized by, at least, two types:
- the size of the internal state
- the field the state uses

```
pub trait Permutation<F: Field, const STATE_SIZE: usize> {
    fn apply_permutation(&self);
}
```

We also want to let the user absorbing different kind of types (field elements,
bytes, group points, etc), i.e. the types should be `absorbable`.

### Sypnosis

The first design attempts to type the transcript for a generic PlonK PIOP, using KZG.
