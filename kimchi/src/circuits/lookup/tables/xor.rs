//~ The lookup table for 4-bit xor.
//~ Note that it is constructed so that `(0, 0, 0)` is the last position in the table.
//~
//~ This is because tables are extended to the full size of a column (essentially)
//~ by padding them with their final value. And, having the value `(0, 0, 0)` here means
//~ that when we commit to this table and use the dummy value in the `lookup_sorted`
//~ columns, those entries that have the dummy value of
//~
//~ $$0 = 0 + j*0 + j^2*0$$
//~
//~ will translate into a scalar multiplication by 0, which is free.

/// Returns the XOR lookup table

/// # Panics

/// Will panic if `data` is invalid.
