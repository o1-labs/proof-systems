//~ ##### Documentation
//~
//~  For more details please see the [Foreign Field Addition RFC](../rfcs/foreign_field_add.md)
//~
//~ ##### Mapping
//~
//~  To make things clearer, the following mapping between the variable names
//~  used in the code and those of the RFC document can be helpful.
//~
//~ ```text
//~     left_input_lo -> a0  right_input_lo -> b0  result_lo -> r0  bound_lo -> u0
//~     left_input_mi -> a1  right_input_mi -> b1  result_mi -> r1  bound_mi -> u1
//~     left_input_hi -> a2  right_input_hi -> b2  result_hi -> r2  bound_hi -> u2
//~
//~     field_overflow  -> q
//~     sign            -> s
//~     carry_lo        -> c0
//~     carry_mi        -> c1
//~     bound_carry_lo  -> k0
//~     bound_carry_mi  -> k1
//~```
//~
//~ Note: Our limbs are 88-bit long. We denote with:
//~  - `lo` the least significant limb (in little-endian, this is from 0 to 87)
//~  - `mi` the middle limb            (in little-endian, this is from 88 to 175)
//~  - `hi` the most significant limb  (in little-endian, this is from 176 to 263)
//~
//~ Let `left_input_lo`, `left_input_mi`, `left_input_hi` be 88-bit limbs of the left element
//~
//~ Let `right_input_lo`, `right_input_mi`, `right_input_hi` be 88-bit limbs of the right element
//~
//~ Let `foreign_modulus_lo`, `foreign_modulus_mi`, `foreign_modulus_hi` be 88-bit limbs of the foreign modulus
//~
//~ Then the limbs of the result are
//~
//~ - `result_lo = left_input_lo +/- right_input_lo - field_overflow * foreign_modulus_lo - 2^{88} * result_carry_lo`
//~ - `result_mi = left_input_mi +/- right_input_mi - field_overflow * foreign_modulus_mi - 2^{88} * result_carry_mi + result_carry_lo`
//~ - `result_hi = left_input_hi +/- right_input_hi - field_overflow * foreign_modulus_hi + result_carry_mi`
//~
//~ `field_overflow` $=0$ or $1$ or $-1$ handles overflows in the field
//~
//~ `result_carry_i` $= -1, 0, 1$ are auxiliary variables that handle carries between limbs
//~
//~ Apart from the range checks of the chained inputs, we need to do an additional range check for a final bound
//~ to make sure that the result is less than the modulus, by adding `2^{3*88} - foreign_modulus` to it.
//~ (This can be computed easily from the limbs of the modulus)
//~ Note that `2^{264}` as limbs represents: (0, 0, 0, 1) then:
//~
//~ The upper-bound check can be calculated as
//~ - `bound_lo = result_lo - foreign_modulus_lo - bound_carry_lo * 2^{88}`
//~ - `bound_mi = result_mi - foreign_modulus_mi - bound_carry_mi * 2^{88} + bound_carry_lo`
//~ - `bound_hi = result_hi - foreign_modulus_hi + 2^{88} + bound_carry_mi`
//~
//~ Which is equivalent to another foreign field addition with right input 2^{264}, q = 1 and s = 1
//~ - `bound_lo = result_lo + s *      0 - q * foreign_modulus_lo - bound_carry_lo * 2^{88}`
//~ - `bound_mi = result_mi + s *      0 - q * foreign_modulus_mi - bound_carry_mi * 2^{88} + bound_carry_lo`
//~ - `bound_hi = result_hi + s * 2^{88} - q * foreign_modulus_hi                           + bound_carry_mi`
//~
//~ `bound_carry_i` $= 0$ or $1$ or $-1$ are auxiliary variables that handle carries between limbs
//~
//~ The range check of `bound` can be skipped until the end of the operations
//~ and `result` is an intermediate value that is unused elsewhere (since the final `result`
//~ must have had the right amount of moduli subtracted along the way, meaning a multiple of the modulus).
//~ In other words, intermediate results could potentially give a valid witness that satisfies the constraints
//~ but where the result is larger than the modulus (yet smaller than 2^{264}). The reason that we have a
//~ final bound check is to make sure that the final result (`min_result`) is indeed the minimum one
//~ (meaning less than the modulus).
//~
//~ A more optimized version of these constraints is able to reduce by 2 the number of constraints and
//~ by 1 the number of witness cells needed. The idea is to condense the low and middle limbs in one longer
//~ limb of 176 bits (which fits inside our native field) and getting rid of the low carry flag.
//~ With this idea in mind, the sole carry flag we need is the one located between the middle and the high limbs.
//~
//~ ##### Layout
//~
//~ The sign of the operation (whether it is an addition or a subtraction) is stored in the fourth coefficient as
//~ a value +1 (for addition) or -1 (for subtraction). The first 3 coefficients are the 3 limbs of the foreign modulus.
//~ One could lay this out as a double-width gate for chained foreign additions and a final row, e.g.:
//~
//~ | col | `ForeignFieldAdd`        | chain `ForeignFieldAdd` | final `ForeignFieldAdd` | final `Zero`      |
//~ | --- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
//~ |   0 | `left_input_lo`  (copy)  | `result_lo` (copy)      | `min_result_lo` (copy)  | `bound_lo` (copy) |
//~ |   1 | `left_input_mi`  (copy)  | `result_mi` (copy)      | `min_result_mi` (copy)  | `bound_mi` (copy) |
//~ |   2 | `left_input_hi`  (copy)  | `result_hi` (copy)      | `min_result_hi` (copy)  | `bound_hi` (copy) |
//~ |   3 | `right_input_lo` (copy)  |                         |  0              (check) |                   |
//~ |   4 | `right_input_mi` (copy)  |                         |  0              (check) |                   |
//~ |   5 | `right_input_hi` (copy)  |                         |  2^88           (check) |                   |
//~ |   6 | `field_overflow` (copy?) |                         |  1              (check) |                   |
//~ |   7 | `carry`                  |                         | `bound_carry`           |                   |

//~ We reuse the foreign field addition gate for the final bound check since this is an addition with a
//~ specific parameter structure. Checking that the correct right input, overflow, and overflow are used shall
//~ be done by copy constraining these values with a public input value. One could have a specific gate
//~ for just this check requiring less constrains, but the cost of adding one more selector gate outweights
//~ the savings of one row and a few constraints of difference.
//~
//~ ##### Integration
//~
//~ - Copy final overflow bit from public input containing value 1
//~ - Range check the final bound
//~
