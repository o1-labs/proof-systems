//~ `Rot64` onstrains known-length rotation of 64-bit words:
//~
//~ * This circuit gate is used to constrain that a 64-bit word is rotated by $r < 64$ bits to the "left".
//~ * The rotation is performed towards the most significant side (thus, the new LSB is fed with the old MSB).
//~ * This gate operates on the `Curr` and `Next` rows.
//~
//~ The idea is to split the rotation operation into two parts:
//~
//~ * Shift to the left
//~ * Add the excess bits to the right
//~
//~ We represent shifting with multiplication modulo $2^{64}$. That is, for each word to be rotated, we provide in
//~ the witness a quotient and a remainder, similarly to `ForeignFieldMul` such that the following operation holds:
//~
//~ $$word \cdot 2^{rot} = quotient \cdot 2^{64} + remainder$$
//~
//~ Then, the remainder corresponds to the shifted word, and the quotient corresponds to the excess bits.
//~
//~ $$word \cdot 2^{rot} = excess \cdot 2^{64} + shifted$$
//~
//~ Thus, in order to obtain the rotated word, we need to add the quotient and the remainder as follows:
//~
//~ $$rotated = shifted + excess$$
//~
//~ The input word is known to be of length 64 bits. All we need for soundness is check that the shifted and
//~ excess parts of the word have the correct size as well. That means, we need to range check that:
//~
//~ $$
//~ \begin{aligned}
//~ excess &< 2^{rot}\\
//~ shifted &< 2^{64}
//~ \end{aligned}
//~ $$
//~
//~ The latter can be obtained with a `RangeCheck0` gate setting the two most significant limbs to zero.
//~ The former is equivalent to the following check:
//~
//~ $$bound = excess - 2^{rot} + 2^{64} < 2^{64}$$
//~
//~ which is doable with the constraints in a `RangeCheck0` gate. Since our current row within the `Rot64` gate
//~ is almost empty, we can use it to perform the range check within the same gate. Then, using the following layout
//~ and assuming that the gate has a coefficient storing the value $2^{rot}$, which is publicly known
//~
//~ | Gate   | `Rot64`             | `RangeCheck0`    |
//~ | ------ | ------------------- | ---------------- |
//~ | Column | `Curr`              | `Next`           |

//~ |      5 |      `bound_limb2`  | `shifted_limb2`  |
//~ |      6 |      `bound_limb3`  | `shifted_limb3`  |
//~ |      7 |      `bound_crumb0` | `shifted_crumb0` |
//~ |      8 |      `bound_crumb1` | `shifted_crumb1` |
//~ |      9 |      `bound_crumb2` | `shifted_crumb2` |
//~ |     10 |      `bound_crumb3` | `shifted_crumb3` |
//~ |     11 |      `bound_crumb4` | `shifted_crumb4` |

//~ In Keccak, rotations are performed over a 5x5 matrix state of w-bit words each cell. The values used
//~ to perform the rotation are fixed, public, and known in advance, according to the following table,
//~ depending on the coordinate of each cell within the 5x5 matrix state:
//~
//~ | y \ x |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |
//~ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//~ | 0     |   0 |  36 |   3 | 105 | 210 |
//~ | 1     |   1 | 300 |  10 |  45 |  66 |
//~ | 2     | 190 |   6 | 171 |  15 | 253 |
//~ | 3     |  28 |  55 | 153 |  21 | 120 |
//~ | 4     |  91 | 276 | 231 | 136 |  78 |
//~
//~ But since we will always be using 64-bit words in our Keccak usecase ($w = 64$), we can have an equivalent
//~ table with these values modulo 64 to avoid needing multiple passes of the rotation gate (a single step would
//~ cause overflows otherwise):
//~
//~ | y \ x |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |
//~ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//~ | 0     |   0 |  36 |   3 |  41 |  18 |
//~ | 1     |   1 |  44 |  10 |  45 |   2 |
//~ | 2     |  62 |   6 |  43 |  15 |  61 |
//~ | 3     |  28 |  55 |  25 |  21 |  56 |
//~ | 4     |  27 |  20 |  39 |   8 |  14 |
//~
//~ Since there is one value of the coordinates (x, y) where the rotation is 0 bits, we can skip that step in the
//~ gadget. This will save us one gate, and thus the whole 25-1=24 rotations will be performed in just 48 rows.
