//~ We implement the AND gadget making use of the XOR gadget and the Generic gate. A new gate type is not needed, but we could potentially
//~ add an `And16` gate type reusing the same ideas of `Xor16` so as to save one final generic gate, at the cost of one additional AND
//~ lookup table that would have the same size as that of the Xor.
//~ For now, we are willing to pay this small overhead and produce AND gadget as follows:
//~
//~ We observe that we can express bitwise addition as follows:
//~ $$A + B = (A \oplus B) + 2 \cdot (A \wedge B)$$
//~
//~ where $\oplus$ is the bitwise XOR operation, $\wedge$ is the bitwise AND operation, and $+$ is the addition operation.
//~ In other words, the value of the addition is nothing but the XOR of its operands, plus the carry bit if both operands are 1.
//~ Thus, we can rewrite the above equation to obtain a definition of the AND operation as follows:
//~ $$A \wedge B = \frac{A + B - (A \oplus B)}{2}$$
//~ Let us define the following operations for better readability:
//~
//~ ```text
//~Â a + b = sum
//~ a x b = xor
//~ a ^ b = and
//~ ```
//~
//~ Then, we can rewrite the above equation as follows:
//~ $$ 2 \cdot and = sum - xor $$
//~ which can be expressed as a double generic gate.
//~
//~ Then, our AND gadget for $n$ bytes looks as follows:
//~
//~ * $n/8$ Xor16 gates
//~ * 1 (single) Generic gate to check that the final row of the XOR chain is all zeros.
//~ * 1 (double) Generic gate to check sum $a + b = sum$ and the conjunction equation $2\cdot and = sum - xor$.
//~
//~ Finally, we connect the wires in the following positions (apart from the ones already connected for the XOR gates):
//~
//~ * Column 2 of the first Xor16 row (the output of the XOR operation) is connected to the right input of the second generic operation of the last row.
//~ * Column 2 of the first generic operation of the last row is connected to the left input of the second generic operation of the last row.
//~ Meaning,
//~
//~ * the `xor` in `a x b = xor` is connected to the `xor` in `2 \cdot and = sum - xor`
//~ * the `sum` in `a + b = sum` is connected to the `sum` in `2 \cdot and = sum - xor`
